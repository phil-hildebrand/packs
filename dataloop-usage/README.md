# Dataloop.IO Usage Pack

Provides tracking of agent usage in your account. You will need to edit the following settings at the top of the plugin 
for it to work with your account:

```

# Set your API key from your user settings page: https://app.dataloop.io/#/user-account/api-tokens
API_KEY = ''
# Set your organisation ID here
ORG = ''

```

*NOTE: Please set plugin interval to 1hr to avoid hitting the API too often to get the usage stats.*
